<!-- gpowers preamble (auto, four-module model) -->


# Using gpowers

You have gpowers — a unified methodology + role + tools + business automation distribution. There are four modules, two trigger tracks, and one naming convention you must follow.

## The four modules

- **core/** — methodology skills (TDD, debugging, planning, brainstorming, code review, etc.). Apply these automatically when they fit the task. Tag `(core)` when you reference them in replies.
- **roles/** — role-based slash commands (`/pr-review`, `/cso`, `/plan-ceo-review`, `/investigate`, ...). Do NOT invoke these yourself. **Suggest** them to the user when their input matches a role's trigger. Tag `(roles)` when you reference them.
- **tools/** — capability skills (`/ship`, `/qa`, `/canary`, `/health`, ...). Call them on demand when the task requires that capability. Tag `(tools)`.
- **business/** — optional commercial automation (`/money`, `/money-content`, ...). Only present if installed with `--with-business`. Tag `(business)`.

## Dual-track triggering

- **Auto track** — `core/` only. The session-start hook injected this skill; from here, apply core methodology skills automatically when they apply. Example: bug report → invoke systematic-debugging (core). Implementation request → invoke writing-plans (core) before coding.
- **Explicit track** — `roles/`, `tools/`, `business/`. Wait for the user to type the slash command. You may *suggest* one when a trigger phrase appears: "preparing to ship" → suggest `/pr-review` + `/cso` + `/qa` before `/ship`.

## Namespace tags in replies

When you reference a gpowers skill in user-facing text, append the module tag in parentheses so the user knows where it lives:

- "I'll use brainstorming (core) to walk this through."
- "Consider `/cso` (roles) for a security review."
- "I'll run /qa (tools) against the staging URL."
- "money-content (business) covers that workflow."

## Skill priority

When multiple skills could apply, follow this order:
1. **Process skills first** (brainstorming, systematic-debugging, executing-plans)
2. **Implementation skills next** (writing-plans, TDD)
3. **Role / tool skills only when user-invoked** or suggested with explicit user confirmation

## Routing for overlapping skills

Three pairs are intentionally similar but serve distinct purposes. Use this table to decide:

### Debugging / investigation

| Situation | Use |
|---|---|
| Any bug, test failure, unexpected behavior — needs fixing | `systematic-debugging` (core) — auto-triggered, no output doc |
| Root-cause analysis that needs a written investigation report, or when user explicitly wants `/investigate` | `/investigate` (roles) — user-invoked, writes `$(gpowers-path project investigate)/<slug>.md` |

"Iron Law: no fixes without root cause" applies to both. The difference is outputs and invocation: `systematic-debugging` runs silently in the background of any coding session; `/investigate` is a deliberate role-based ceremony with a persisted artifact.

### Brainstorming / ideation

| Situation | Use |
|---|---|
| "I have a feature idea / how should I build X" — design-first workflow | `brainstorming` (core) — auto-triggered, leads to spec + writing-plans |
| "Is this worth building?", "validate my idea", "startup thinking", "office hours" | `/office-hours` (roles) — user-invoked, YC-style six forcing questions + Builder mode |

`brainstorming` always ends in a spec and a plan. `/office-hours` may conclude that an idea is *not* worth building — that's a valid outcome. If `office-hours` results in "yes, build it", transition to `brainstorming` to write the spec.

### Code review

| Situation | Use |
|---|---|
| After completing a task or major feature — dispatch a fresh reviewer subagent | `requesting-code-review` (core) — auto-triggered, subagent reviews your work |
| Pre-merge: comprehensive PR audit against checklist before `/ship` | `/pr-review` (roles) — user-invoked, runs full review with specialist passes |
| After receiving review feedback — deciding what to act on | `receiving-code-review` (core) — auto-triggered, structures your response to feedback |

The typical flow: code → `requesting-code-review` (core, catches issues early) → `/pr-review` (roles, gate before merge) → `receiving-code-review` (core, if reviewer pushes back).

## Reading the rest

Use the `Skill` tool (Claude Code / Codex / OpenCode), `activate_skill` (Gemini), or skill-name reference (Kimi) to load any specific skill. Skill files live under `$GPOWERS_HOME/<module>/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` — never read them by absolute path; use the platform's skill mechanism so per-platform adaptations apply.

Path queries go through `gpowers-path` (`gpowers-path config`, `gpowers-path project plans`, ...) — never concatenate `~/.gpowers/` directly in skills.

# Finishing a Development Branch

## Overview

Guide completion of development work by presenting clear options and handling chosen workflow.

**Core principle:** Verify tests → Detect environment → Present options → Execute choice → Clean up.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the finishing-a-development-branch skill to complete this work."

## The Process

### Step 1: Verify Tests

**Before presenting options, verify tests pass:**

```bash
# Run project's test suite
npm test / cargo test / pytest / go test ./...
```

**If tests fail:**
```
Tests failing (<N> failures). Must fix before completing:

[Show failures]

Cannot proceed with merge/PR until tests pass.
```

Stop. Don't proceed to Step 2.

**If tests pass:** Continue to Step 2.

### Step 2: Detect Environment

**Determine workspace state before presenting options:**

```bash
GIT_DIR=$(cd "$(git rev-parse --git-dir)" 2>/dev/null && pwd -P)
GIT_COMMON=$(cd "$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)" 2>/dev/null && pwd -P)
```

This determines which menu to show and how cleanup works:

| State | Menu | Cleanup |
|-------|------|---------|
| `GIT_DIR == GIT_COMMON` (normal repo) | Standard 4 options | No worktree to clean up |
| `GIT_DIR != GIT_COMMON`, named branch | Standard 4 options | Provenance-based (see Step 6) |
| `GIT_DIR != GIT_COMMON`, detached HEAD | Reduced 3 options (no merge) | No cleanup (externally managed) |

### Step 3: Determine Base Branch

```bash
# Try common base branches
git merge-base HEAD main 2>/dev/null || git merge-base HEAD master 2>/dev/null
```

Or ask: "This branch split from main - is that correct?"

### Step 4: Present Options

**Normal repo and named-branch worktree — present exactly these 4 options:**

```
Implementation complete. What would you like to do?

1. Merge back to <base-branch> locally
2. Push and create a Pull Request
3. Keep the branch as-is (I'll handle it later)
4. Discard this work

Which option?
```

**Detached HEAD — present exactly these 3 options:**

```
Implementation complete. You're on a detached HEAD (externally managed workspace).

1. Push as new branch and create a Pull Request
2. Keep as-is (I'll handle it later)
3. Discard this work

Which option?
```

**Don't add explanation** - keep options concise.

### Step 5: Execute Choice

#### Option 1: Merge Locally

```bash
# Get main repo root for CWD safety
MAIN_ROOT=$(git -C "$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)/.." rev-parse --show-toplevel)
cd "$MAIN_ROOT"

# Merge first — verify success before removing anything
git checkout <base-branch>
git pull
git merge <feature-branch>

# Verify tests on merged result
<test command>

# Only after merge succeeds: cleanup worktree (Step 6), then delete branch
```

Then: Cleanup worktree (Step 6), then delete branch:

```bash
git branch -d <feature-branch>
```

#### Option 2: Push and Create PR

```bash
# Push branch
git push -u origin <feature-branch>

# Create PR
gh pr create --title "<title>" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
<2-3 bullets of what changed>

## Test Plan
- [ ] <verification steps>
EOF
)"
```

**Do NOT clean up worktree** — user needs it alive to iterate on PR feedback.

#### Option 3: Keep As-Is

Report: "Keeping branch <name>. Worktree preserved at <path>."

**Don't cleanup worktree.**

#### Option 4: Discard

**Confirm first:**
```
This will permanently delete:
- Branch <name>
- All commits: <commit-list>
- Worktree at <path>

Type 'discard' to confirm.
```

Wait for exact confirmation.

If confirmed:
```bash
MAIN_ROOT=$(git -C "$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)/.." rev-parse --show-toplevel)
cd "$MAIN_ROOT"
```

Then: Cleanup worktree (Step 6), then force-delete branch:
```bash
git branch -D <feature-branch>
```

### Step 6: Cleanup Workspace

**Only runs for Options 1 and 4.** Options 2 and 3 always preserve the worktree.

```bash
GIT_DIR=$(cd "$(git rev-parse --git-dir)" 2>/dev/null && pwd -P)
GIT_COMMON=$(cd "$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)" 2>/dev/null && pwd -P)
WORKTREE_PATH=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
```

**If `GIT_DIR == GIT_COMMON`:** Normal repo, no worktree to clean up. Done.

**If worktree path is under `.worktrees/`, `worktrees/`, or `$(gpowers-path state)/worktrees/`:** Superpowers created this worktree — we own cleanup.

```bash
MAIN_ROOT=$(git -C "$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)/.." rev-parse --show-toplevel)
cd "$MAIN_ROOT"
git worktree remove "$WORKTREE_PATH"
git worktree prune  # Self-healing: clean up any stale registrations
```

**Otherwise:** The host environment (harness) owns this workspace. Do NOT remove it. If your platform provides a workspace-exit tool, use it. Otherwise, leave the workspace in place.

## Quick Reference

| Option | Merge | Push | Keep Worktree | Cleanup Branch |
|--------|-------|------|---------------|----------------|
| 1. Merge locally | yes | - | - | yes |
| 2. Create PR | - | yes | yes | - |
| 3. Keep as-is | - | - | yes | - |
| 4. Discard | - | - | - | yes (force) |

## Common Mistakes

**Skipping test verification**
- **Problem:** Merge broken code, create failing PR
- **Fix:** Always verify tests before offering options

**Open-ended questions**
- **Problem:** "What should I do next?" is ambiguous
- **Fix:** Present exactly 4 structured options (or 3 for detached HEAD)

**Cleaning up worktree for Option 2**
- **Problem:** Remove worktree user needs for PR iteration
- **Fix:** Only cleanup for Options 1 and 4

**Deleting branch before removing worktree**
- **Problem:** `git branch -d` fails because worktree still references the branch
- **Fix:** Merge first, remove worktree, then delete branch

**Running git worktree remove from inside the worktree**
- **Problem:** Command fails silently when CWD is inside the worktree being removed
- **Fix:** Always `cd` to main repo root before `git worktree remove`

**Cleaning up harness-owned worktrees**
- **Problem:** Removing a worktree the harness created causes phantom state
- **Fix:** Only clean up worktrees under `.worktrees/`, `worktrees/`, or `$(gpowers-path state)/worktrees/`

**No confirmation for discard**
- **Problem:** Accidentally delete work
- **Fix:** Require typed "discard" confirmation

## Red Flags

**Never:**
- Proceed with failing tests
- Merge without verifying tests on result
- Delete work without confirmation
- Force-push without explicit request
- Remove a worktree before confirming merge success
- Clean up worktrees you didn't create (provenance check)
- Run `git worktree remove` from inside the worktree

**Always:**
- Verify tests before offering options
- Detect environment before presenting menu
- Present exactly 4 options (or 3 for detached HEAD)
- Get typed confirmation for Option 4
- Clean up worktree for Options 1 & 4 only
- `cd` to main repo root before worktree removal
- Run `git worktree prune` after removal
