# Using gpowers

You have gpowers — a unified methodology + role + tools automation distribution. There are three modules, two trigger tracks, and one naming convention you must follow.

## The three modules

- **core/** — methodology skills (TDD, debugging, planning, brainstorming, code review, etc.). Apply these automatically when they fit the task. Tag `(core)` when you reference them in replies.
- **roles/** — role-based slash commands (`/pr-review`, `/cso`, `/plan-ceo-review`, `/investigate`, ...). Do NOT invoke these yourself. **Suggest** them to the user when their input matches a role's trigger. Tag `(roles)` when you reference them.
- **tools/** — capability skills (`/ship`, `/qa`, `/canary`, `/health`, ...). Call them on demand when the task requires that capability. Tag `(tools)`.


## Dual-track triggering

- **Auto track** — `core/` only. The session-start hook injected this skill; from here, apply core methodology skills automatically when they apply. Example: bug report → invoke systematic-debugging (core). Implementation request → invoke writing-plans (core) before coding.
- **Explicit track** — `roles/`, `tools/`. Wait for the user to type the slash command. You may *suggest* one when a trigger phrase appears: "preparing to ship" → suggest `/pr-review` + `/cso` + `/qa` before `/ship`.

## Namespace tags in replies

When you reference a gpowers skill in user-facing text, append the module tag in parentheses so the user knows where it lives:

- "I'll use brainstorming (core) to walk this through."
- "Consider `/cso` (roles) for a security review."
- "I'll run /qa (tools) against the staging URL."


## Language consistency

When communicating with the user — asking questions, presenting options, explaining trade-offs, or reporting results — **output in the same language the user is writing in**. If the user writes in Chinese, reply in Chinese. If the user writes in English, reply in English. This reduces comprehension friction and ensures the user can fully understand proposals and make informed decisions.

## Skill priority

When multiple skills could apply, follow this order:
1. **Process skills first** (brainstorming, systematic-debugging, executing-plans)
2. **Implementation skills next** (writing-plans, TDD)
3. **Role / tool skills only when user-invoked** or suggested with explicit user confirmation

## Routing for overlapping skills

Three pairs are intentionally similar but serve distinct purposes. Use this table to decide:

### Debugging / investigation

| Situation | Use |
|---|---|
| Any bug, test failure, unexpected behavior — needs fixing | `systematic-debugging` (core) — auto-triggered, no output doc |
| Root-cause analysis that needs a written investigation report, or when user explicitly wants `/investigate` | `/investigate` (roles) — user-invoked, writes `$(gpowers-path project investigate)/<slug>.md` |

"Iron Law: no fixes without root cause" applies to both. The difference is outputs and invocation: `systematic-debugging` runs silently in the background of any coding session; `/investigate` is a deliberate role-based ceremony with a persisted artifact.

### Brainstorming / ideation

| Situation | Use |
|---|---|
| "I have a feature idea / how should I build X" — design-first workflow | `brainstorming` (core) — auto-triggered, leads to spec + writing-plans |
| "Is this worth building?", "validate my idea", "startup thinking", "office hours" | `/office-hours` (roles) — user-invoked, YC-style six forcing questions + Builder mode |

`brainstorming` always ends in a spec and a plan. `/office-hours` may conclude that an idea is *not* worth building — that's a valid outcome. If `office-hours` results in "yes, build it", transition to `brainstorming` to write the spec.

### Code review

| Situation | Use |
|---|---|
| After completing a task or major feature — dispatch a fresh reviewer subagent | `requesting-code-review` (core) — auto-triggered, subagent reviews your work |
| Pre-merge: comprehensive PR audit against checklist before `/ship` | `/pr-review` (roles) — user-invoked, runs full review with specialist passes |
| After receiving review feedback — deciding what to act on | `receiving-code-review` (core) — auto-triggered, structures your response to feedback |

The typical flow: code → `requesting-code-review` (core, catches issues early) → `/pr-review` (roles, gate before merge) → `receiving-code-review` (core, if reviewer pushes back).

## Reading the rest

Use the `Skill` tool (Claude Code / Codex / OpenCode), `activate_skill` (Gemini), or skill-name reference (Kimi) to load any specific skill. Skill files live under `$GPOWERS_HOME/<module>/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` — never read them by absolute path; use the platform's skill mechanism so per-platform adaptations apply.

Path queries go through `gpowers-path` (`gpowers-path config`, `gpowers-path project plans`, ...) — never concatenate `~/.gpowers/` directly in skills.

# /careful — Destructive Command Guardrails

Safety mode is now **active**. Every bash command will be checked for destructive
patterns before running. If a destructive command is detected, you'll be warned
and can choose to proceed or cancel.

```bash
mkdir -p $(gpowers-path analytics)
echo '{"skill":"careful","ts":"'$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)'","repo":"'$(basename "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)" 2>/dev/null || echo "unknown")'"}'  >> $(gpowers-path analytics)/skill-usage.jsonl 2>/dev/null || true
```

## What's protected

| Pattern | Example | Risk |
|---------|---------|------|
| `rm -rf` / `rm -r` / `rm --recursive` | `rm -rf /var/data` | Recursive delete |
| `DROP TABLE` / `DROP DATABASE` | `DROP TABLE users;` | Data loss |
| `TRUNCATE` | `TRUNCATE orders;` | Data loss |
| `git push --force` / `-f` | `git push -f origin main` | History rewrite |
| `git reset --hard` | `git reset --hard HEAD~3` | Uncommitted work loss |
| `git checkout .` / `git restore .` | `git checkout .` | Uncommitted work loss |
| `kubectl delete` | `kubectl delete pod` | Production impact |
| `docker rm -f` / `docker system prune` | `docker system prune -a` | Container/image loss |

## Safe exceptions

These patterns are allowed without warning:
- `rm -rf node_modules` / `.next` / `dist` / `__pycache__` / `.cache` / `build` / `.turbo` / `coverage`

## How it works

The hook reads the command from the tool input JSON, checks it against the
patterns above, and returns `permissionDecision: "ask"` with a warning message
if a match is found. You can always override the warning and proceed.

To deactivate, end the conversation or start a new one. Hooks are session-scoped.
