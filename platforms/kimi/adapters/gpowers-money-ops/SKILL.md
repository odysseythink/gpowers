<!-- gpowers preamble (auto, four-module model) -->


# Using gpowers

You have gpowers — a unified methodology + role + tools + business automation distribution. There are four modules, two trigger tracks, and one naming convention you must follow.

## The four modules

- **core/** — methodology skills (TDD, debugging, planning, brainstorming, code review, etc.). Apply these automatically when they fit the task. Tag `(core)` when you reference them in replies.
- **roles/** — role-based slash commands (`/pr-review`, `/cso`, `/plan-ceo-review`, `/investigate`, ...). Do NOT invoke these yourself. **Suggest** them to the user when their input matches a role's trigger. Tag `(roles)` when you reference them.
- **tools/** — capability skills (`/ship`, `/qa`, `/canary`, `/health`, ...). Call them on demand when the task requires that capability. Tag `(tools)`.
- **business/** — optional commercial automation (`/money`, `/money-content`, ...). Only present if installed with `--with-business`. Tag `(business)`.

## Dual-track triggering

- **Auto track** — `core/` only. The session-start hook injected this skill; from here, apply core methodology skills automatically when they apply. Example: bug report → invoke systematic-debugging (core). Implementation request → invoke writing-plans (core) before coding.
- **Explicit track** — `roles/`, `tools/`, `business/`. Wait for the user to type the slash command. You may *suggest* one when a trigger phrase appears: "preparing to ship" → suggest `/pr-review` + `/cso` + `/qa` before `/ship`.

## Namespace tags in replies

When you reference a gpowers skill in user-facing text, append the module tag in parentheses so the user knows where it lives:

- "I'll use brainstorming (core) to walk this through."
- "Consider `/cso` (roles) for a security review."
- "I'll run /qa (tools) against the staging URL."
- "money-content (business) covers that workflow."

## Skill priority

When multiple skills could apply, follow this order:
1. **Process skills first** (brainstorming, systematic-debugging, executing-plans)
2. **Implementation skills next** (writing-plans, TDD)
3. **Role / tool skills only when user-invoked** or suggested with explicit user confirmation

## Reading the rest

Use the `Skill` tool (Claude Code / Codex / OpenCode), `activate_skill` (Gemini), or skill-name reference (Kimi) to load any specific skill. Skill files live under `$GPOWERS_HOME/<module>/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` — never read them by absolute path; use the platform's skill mechanism so per-platform adaptations apply.

Path queries go through `gpowers-path` (`gpowers-path config`, `gpowers-path project plans`, ...) — never concatenate `~/.gpowers/` directly in skills.

# money-ops

Commercial / strategy skill. Writes to $(gpowers-path data)/money-ops/.


> _Business module note:_ this skill is part of the optional `business/` module installed with `--with-business`. See `business/DISCLAIMER.md` for the dual-use / responsible-automation notice.
